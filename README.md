Problem :    Food In-Security

Household Food security exists when all members at all time have access to enough food for an active healthy life. Individuals who are food secured do not live in hunger or fear of starvation . Food insecurity on the other hand is the situation of uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability ""------ to acquire acceptable food in socially acceptable ways ------"" according to United States Dept. of Agriculture.

Narendra Modi in his most recent Mann Ki Baat radio, asked his listeners: “Have you ever thought about how much food we waste?”


Hack :     AKSHAYAPATRA

This hack will provide-
	Availability of food to the needy.
	Access to everyone.
	"""Utilisation of wastage""".

UTILISATION OF WASTAGE----------------------------------------

There are people(Restaurants, Marriage Halls, Households) who want to serve their excess food to the needy but do not have a medium to communicate.
Even on the other side, the needy do not know who is ready to fulfill their needs.

Due to this disconnection in the communication, there is a lot of """FOOD WASTAGE""" .
Let's prevent it then.
